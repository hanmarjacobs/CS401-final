Greater Baja Blast Reinstatement`As you well know, the International Wizards Without Ethics council has recently released the 2022 Banned Spell List, upon which was written the controversial list of classic spells that will no longer be considered "legal" in eyes of the arcanum. Among other great wizardries - including Super Brain Hemorrhage and Transmute Idaho - Greater Baja Blast has been deemed not safe for wizards, even though we've all cast these spells many times with no harm to ourselves and very little harm that mattered to the general populace. Idaho has been fine! I call for a duel before the council to defend the honor of all Baja Blasting, righteous wizards in this community! We deserve representation!
warlocks r cool too?`idk about you all but i think warlocks are valid and like, kinda hot? #warlockhottie #antonleBAE
ORB MISSING!!!`My mystic orb has gone missing!! It's blue and round and very magic, anyone who got their hands on that needs to be very careful! I just cast Epic Fireball with it yesterday so I hope whoever took it got their hands burnt (cause my magicks are so strong that the residual energy totally kept it piping hot!!!!)!
